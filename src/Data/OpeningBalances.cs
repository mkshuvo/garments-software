/// other. Every real ERP posts that 25,000 to capital and shows it, because the alternative — a
/// validator that refuses the import until the owner finds the 25,000 — sends someone back through a
/// shoebox of receipts to reconcile a figure that is almost certainly their own equity. Making the
/// assumption explicit and inspectable is the honest version, and it is why the code posts one entry
/// rather than editing balances until they agree.
/// </para>

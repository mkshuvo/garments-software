/// It does not save, and that is the whole design. An audit row describes a change; if the two commit
/// separately then one of them can be a lie. Saved immediately, a posting that rolls back afterwards
/// leaves a permanent record of money that never moved; saved by the caller afterwards, a change can
/// land with nothing describing who made it. Tracking into the same context means the entry and its
/// audit row are written by the same commit or by neither.

/// <para>
/// The consequence to know: <b>appending without a later save loses the row.</b> Every caller therefore
/// owns a unit of work. That is a real hazard rather than a neatness, and it is why the legacy build's
/// writer — which caught and swallowed every exception — produced an audit trail that looked populated
/// while being silently incomplete, which is worse than an empty one because nobody investigates an
/// empty trail.
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// It does not swallow failures either. If the audit row cannot be written, the change that depends on
/// it does not happen; a ledger whose trail can be quietly omitted is not an auditable ledger.

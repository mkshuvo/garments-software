/// status to decide whether a line may change, so the poster inserts every line while the entry is still
/// <c>Draft</c> and flips the status last. A poster that set <c>Posted</c> first would be refused by this
/// trigger — loudly, in the same transaction, with the entry id in the message. That is the intended
/// behaviour, not a hazard: the alternative is a rule that can be broken quietly.

/// Draft to Posted <i>is</i> an update on <c>gl_entries</c>, so revoking update revokes posting. Editing a

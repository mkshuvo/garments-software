/// policy says — which is how the legacy build let any Manager read any company's ledger while the
/// policies looked correct in the migration. This probe turns that into a startup failure instead of a
/// deployment detail nobody checks.
///
/// It reads the schema as well as the role: every table the model claims is tenant-owned must have
/// row-level security enabled, forced, and a policy with the exact name the migration creates. A
/// migration that was never applied, or a policy that was edited by hand, fails here rather than
/// showing a plausible-looking empty screen to the customer.

/// <para><b>Debit and credit are separate nullable columns, not a single signed amount.</b> A signed
/// column is tempting and loses information: "0" and "no entry on this side" become the same thing, and
/// the balance check becomes arithmetic on signs instead of two sums that must be equal. The database
/// enforces exactly-one-of with a CHECK, which a signed column cannot express.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Both currencies are stored on the line.</b> <see cref="AmountInCurrency"/> is what the
/// invoice said; <see cref="Debit"/>/<see cref="Credit"/> are the functional-currency figures the ledger
/// balances. Storing only the converted amount makes a foreign-currency original impossible to
/// reconcile, which is the difference between an FX revaluation entry and a guess. This is the
/// Odoo <c>debit</c>/<c>amount_currency</c> and ERPNext
/// <c>debit_in_account_currency</c> pattern.</para>

/// <para><b>The rate is snapshotted with its effective date.</b> Re-reading a rate table at report time
/// would rewrite history every time a rate is corrected.</para>

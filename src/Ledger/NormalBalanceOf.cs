/// <c>FinalBalance = credits − debits</c>, which is zero for any balanced ledger and therefore
/// meaningless; <c>TrialBalanceService</c> returned debits as negative numbers; and
/// <c>BalanceService</c> used normal-balance signs. Three screens, three answers, one database.
///
/// It is a pure function of <see cref="AccountType"/> here, so there is exactly one answer and it
/// cannot drift from the data.

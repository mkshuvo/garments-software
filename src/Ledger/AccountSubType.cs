/// <remarks>
/// The legacy tree derived this by string matching on account names —
/// <c>accountNameLower.Contains("cash")</c> — inside the trial balance service. That means renaming an
/// account moves money between lines of the balance sheet, and a tenant who names an account
/// "Cash Discount Received" gets it classified as an asset.
///
/// It is a column here, and it is <b>immutable once the account has been posted to</b>: the old code
/// let <c>AccountType</c> be changed on a live account, which silently inverted the sign of every
/// historical balance for that account while leaving the ledger untouched. Reports that had been
/// correct the week before stopped being correct, with nothing in the data to explain it.

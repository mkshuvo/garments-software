/// <summary>
/// One accounting period, with the three locks that decide what may still be written into it.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The legacy system had no period concept at all: no fiscal year, no close, no lock date, and an
/// <c>OpeningBalance</c> column that nothing read. Without a lock there is no such thing as a closed
/// book, so an accountant cannot sign off on anything and a backdated entry can quietly change a
/// period whose VAT return has already been filed.
///
/// The three tiers follow Odoo, because they solve three different problems:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><description><b>Soft lock</b> — non-advisers may not post; an accountant still can, because
/// adjustments after a return are normal and blocking them pushes people into editing live rows.</description></item>
/// <item><description><b>Hard lock</b> — nobody posting through the application. Overridable only by
/// direct database access, which is the point.</description></item>
/// <item><description><b>Tax lock</b> — the filing boundary, so a return can be reproduced exactly.</description></item>
/// </list>

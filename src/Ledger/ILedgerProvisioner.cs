/// theoretical: onboarding a factory means importing a closing balance sheet from whatever the
/// accountant used before, and that run gets interrupted. A first attempt that half-wrote the chart of
/// accounts and then crashed would leave a company unable to receive its balances, with no obvious way
/// to finish. Re-running the same year is therefore expected, and it must add nothing.
///
/// It does not create the tenant. That is tenancy's job and happens first; this gives an existing
/// company its books.

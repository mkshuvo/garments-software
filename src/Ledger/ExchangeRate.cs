/// <b>Effective-dated rather than current.</b> A single "rate today" column makes every historical
/// statement a lie as soon as it moves: re-run last month's reports in June and the export invoice is
/// worth a different amount, and the trial balance no longer reconciles to the one that was filed. The
/// question a ledger asks is never "what is it worth now" but "what did it cost on the day", and that
/// answer cannot change after the fact.

///
/// <para>
/// <b>One row per currency per effective date, never edited.</b> A rate is history the moment it is
/// recorded, so correcting a wrong one means a row with the same <see cref="ValidFrom"/> — which the
/// unique index refuses — or a new date. That friction is deliberate: a rate that has already been used
/// by a posted line cannot be restated underneath it without the posting and its source disagreeing,
/// and a ledger must not be able to reach that state quietly.

/// <para>
/// There is no <c>IsActive</c> or soft delete. Deactivating a historical rate is the same act as

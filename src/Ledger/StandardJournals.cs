/// Six, and each one exists because a document type needs its own gapless sequence rather than its own
/// row in a settings screen. A single journal for everything would number an invoice and a payroll
/// transfer as neighbours, so a missing number would mean nothing and an owner could not say "the
/// entries between INV-000041 and INV-000043 are the ones I am asking about".
///
/// <see cref="OpeningCode"/> is the one this list exists to include. The legacy build had
/// <c>JournalType.Opening</c> in its enum and referenced it nowhere, so opening balances were posted as
/// ordinary manual journals with no marker, no separate sequence, and no way to tell the founding
/// figures of a company from a Friday correction.

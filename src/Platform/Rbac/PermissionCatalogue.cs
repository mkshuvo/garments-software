/// The single source of truth for what can be authorised. The migration seeds these rows and the
/// provisioner grants them to roles, so a permission that is not written down here does not exist
/// anywhere.
///
/// <b>How these keys are enforced today.</b> Endpoints declare <c>[Authorize(Roles = ...)]</c> and the
/// role is read from the token. Nothing yet demands a permission key at the gate, so <c>(resource,
/// action)</c> is currently the vocabulary for <em>granting</em> a role, not the check itself. An
/// <c>IPermissionRequirement</c> handler that turns a key into a policy is the missing half; until it
/// exists, this comment says what is true rather than what the design intends, because a doc comment
/// describing an unbuilt component is how <c>JournalType.Opening</c> sat referenced by nothing.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A <c>(resource, action)</c> pair rather than ad-hoc role names, because the buyer's staff is hired
/// by function: the accounts clerk needs <c>company.update</c> and nothing else, and that decision must
/// survive the clerk also being called "Senior Officer" in another factory.

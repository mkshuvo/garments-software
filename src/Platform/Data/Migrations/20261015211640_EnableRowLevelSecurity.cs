/// This migration is the reason the rest of the tenancy design is real rather than aspirational.
/// Row-level security does not apply to a superuser or to a role holding BYPASSRLS, and the
/// application was connecting as <c>postgres</c> — so without a dedicated runtime principal, every
/// policy written here would be silently ignored and the isolation suite would pass while
/// protecting nothing. That is the "worked, returned nothing" failure this project is built to
/// refuse, in its most expensive form.
///
/// Ownership and runtime privilege are split deliberately: <c>garments_owner</c> creates and alters,
/// <c>garments_app</c> reads and writes and is subject to the policies. <c>FORCE ROW LEVEL
/// SECURITY</c> is applied anyway so that even a misconfigured deployment where the owner connects
/// cannot read across tenants.

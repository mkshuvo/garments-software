/// <para>
/// This type is the shape of the creation door, and the fields that are missing from it are the point. There
/// is no name-only constructor, no code that can be typed, no currency that defaults to the tenant's, and no
/// "created on" that reads a clock: <see cref="RegisteredAt"/> is supplied by the caller so the domain has one
/// time source and a test can pin it. Anything the caller has not decided stays undecided rather than being
/// filled in, because a defaulted master record is indistinguishable from a real one after a hundred rows.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// Addresses, contact points and bank accounts are optional here and become mandatory at the moment they are
/// needed: a customer must have a registered address before it can be invoiced, and no partner can be paid
/// before it has a payment channel. Refusing at creation would block the small supplier a pilot tenant
/// genuinely has, and refusing at use is the honest version of the same rule.

/// Reported per collision rather than as a bare boolean because the repair differs by kind. A matching e-TIN
/// means the record on screen is the same legal entity and the clerk is looking at a duplicate; a matching
/// phone number usually means two businesses share one agent's handset, and the answer is to add the missing
/// identifiers, not to abandon the record.

/// <param name="Kind">Which register both records claim to hold.</param>
/// <param name="Authority">How much that register proves: authoritative matches confirm, suggestive matches raise.</param>

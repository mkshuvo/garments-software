/// A partner that is both customer and vendor has two accounts and they must never be conflated. The
/// receivable is an asset that grows on a debit; the payable is a liability that grows on a credit. The
/// legacy tree kept one "Account" field on its party record, so a dual-role trading house's bill and its
/// invoice landed on the same account and netted silently — the owner's "what do I owe" and "what am I owed"
/// became one number, and both were wrong.

/// This type therefore cannot be constructed for anything but the two trade subtypes. A caller that wants to
/// point a partner at an expense or a bank account has to be refused here, at the point where the mistake
/// would otherwise become a posted line. The declared subtype is checked against the chart at write time by
/// the ledger itself; what this guarantees is that a partner's trade account is a receivable or a payable and
/// nothing else.

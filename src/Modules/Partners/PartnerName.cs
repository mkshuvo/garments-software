/// <remarks>
/// A garment trading party routinely has: a name on its trade licence (the legal name, which is what a
/// court and the NBR see), a shorter name it prints on letterheads and stamps (the trading name, often
/// the only one the factory floor uses), and a Bangla rendering used on local documents and vehicle
/// invoices. The legacy tree had one <c>CustomerName</c> column, so a clerk recording "Rupganj Textiles
/// (Pvt) Ltd" against a licence held by "Rupganj Textiles Limited Private" had to choose, and whichever
/// they chose was wrong on one of the two documents that needed it.
///
/// This type deliberately knows nothing about which role the name plays — the aggregate decides that. It
/// only guarantees the text is storable, normalised, and written in a script this product supports.

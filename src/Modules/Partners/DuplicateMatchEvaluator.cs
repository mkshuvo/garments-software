/// A pure function over identifiers, with no repository and no name matching, and that is the substance of
/// the rule rather than a limitation of it. The legacy project let a typed name create master records and

/// an aged-receivables report that is silently wrong is worse than a loud error, because it is trusted.

/// So: match on identifiers only, compare them in their normalised form (<see cref="PartnerIdentifier.MatchKey"/>),
/// confirm only on an authoritative register, and treat a suggestive register as a question for a human. A
/// same-name partner with no shared identifier comes back <see cref="DuplicateVerdict.Unique"/>, which is
/// correct — <c>Rahima Garments</c> is a common trade name and two businesses may hold it.

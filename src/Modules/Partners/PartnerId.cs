/// <remarks>
/// A garment factory's buyer list is a decade of phonebooks, VAT files and shipping documents, and the
/// party in it gets renamed: a sole trader becomes a limited company, a factory adds "Exports" to its
/// name, a spelling is corrected. Every one of those is a rename, not a new business, and the rewrite's
/// legacy tree handled renames by letting people create a second record — which is how one real buyer
/// ended up with two aged-receivables lines and nobody could say which was the money.
///
/// This type is the answer to that: the identifier is minted once at registration and no operation on
/// <see cref="Partner"/> can change it. Codes, names, roles, addresses, bank accounts and terms all move
/// around it while it stays.
///
/// It is a distinct type from <see cref="Guid"/> rather than a bare guid so that an empty guid cannot be
/// passed where a partner is meant — the legacy services accepted <c>Guid.Empty</c> and answered
/// "not found" as if that were a normal outcome.

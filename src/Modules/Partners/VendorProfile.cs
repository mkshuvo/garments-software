/// Fabric, trim, laundry, embroidery and jobwork suppliers are the parties a garment factory's cash cycle
/// actually turns on, and a supplier's terms are the reason a purchase order can be raised at all — a
/// supplier on full advance is not usable for a purchase order unless the factory has the deposit. Holding
/// this as a capability beside <see cref="CustomerProfile"/> on the same partner is what lets a trading house
/// that buys our output and supplies our fabric be one record with two balances, each on its own side of the
/// ledger.
///
/// There is no credit limit here on purpose: what we owe a supplier is not a risk we cap, and an "advance
/// ceiling" would be a different rule that no one has asked for yet.

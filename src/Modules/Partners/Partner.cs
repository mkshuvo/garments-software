/// <para>
/// <b>Why one aggregate and not a customer table plus a vendor table.</b> In garment trade the same party
/// very often buys the output and supplies the input: a trading house places the export order and also
/// releases the knit fabric, a wash plant is paid for jobwork and is bought thread from. Two records for one
/// real business is not untidiness — it splits the receivable and the payable across two ids, so the aged
/// report understates one side, the balance ageing hides the other, and nothing on screen tells the owner the
/// two lines are the same company they have been paying for a decade. Roles are therefore capabilities
/// (<see cref="CustomerProfile"/>, <see cref="VendorProfile"/>) hanging off one identity.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Identity is stable and names are not.</b> <see cref="Id"/> and <see cref="Code"/> are set at
/// registration and there is no operation on this type that changes either. <see cref="ChangeLegalName"/>,
/// <see cref="ChangeTradingName"/> and <see cref="ChangeBanglaName"/> exist because a party's name changes
/// constantly in this market — a proprietorship becomes a limited company, "Exports" is added, a spelling on
/// the trade licence turns out to be wrong. The three names are three fields because they are three facts, and
/// the legal name on a licence, the name on a letterhead and the name in Bangla on a challan are not
/// interchangeable. A rename that leaves every document, ledger line and price list pointing at the same id
/// is the entire point.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Nothing here is creatable from free text.</b> A code comes from <see cref="IPartnerCodeAllocator"/>, an
/// identifier from a named register and is validated into that register's form, a ledger account is a
/// reference to the chart with a declared side, a price line is a reference to a catalogued style id, and a
/// partner cannot exist with fewer identifiers than its declared evidence basis requires. Names are validated
/// as text and are never an identifier: nothing in this aggregate derives a code, an account or a duplicate
/// decision from one.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Refusal is the default.</b> No payment channel, no payment; no credit limit, no credit sale; no
/// effective price list, no price; an open document, no deactivation. Where the legacy tree reached for a
/// default — a first row in a list, a zero balance, a generated code — this type stops and names the reason,
/// because a silent default in a ledger is indistinguishable from a decision and costs more to unwind.

/// This is the rule the legacy project broke and the one that must not be re-broken. It auto-created

/// A random code collides (roughly once every nine hundred rows, so a tenant with a thousand parties hits a
/// collision and either gets a duplicate key error or, worse, an <c>ignore</c>), it cannot be read back in
/// order, and it means the code carries no information about what it names. A code derived from the name is
/// the opposite failure: renaming the party orphans the code, and two parties with similar names collide by
/// construction — <c>RAHIMA</c> and <c>RAHIMA TRADERS</c> are the same clerk's keystrokes.

/// when someone pastes it in; the aggregate adds a second guard

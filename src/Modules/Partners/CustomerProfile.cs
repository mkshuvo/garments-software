/// <summary>
/// The customer capability on a partner: the receivable account, the credit limit and the default payment
/// term. Present only when we actually sell to this party.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A capability rather than a record type, because a factory's buyer list and its supplier list are not two
/// populations — they overlap, and the overlap is where the money is. Splitting the two into separate
/// entities is what makes a trading house that both buys and supplies look like two businesses in an ageing
/// report.
///
/// <see cref="CreditLimit"/> is deliberately a <see cref="Money"/> and deliberately nullable, and the two
/// choices work against each other on purpose. As money it cannot be added to an exposure in another
/// currency by accident; the legacy tree stored limits as bare decimals and a USD limit was once compared
/// against a BDT balance. As a null it means "no limit has been granted", which is <b>not</b> unlimited:
/// <see cref="CreditLimitRule"/> refuses a credit sale when no limit exists instead of treating the absence
/// of a decision as a permissive one. A zero limit is a different and legitimate state — cash before
/// dispatch — and is stored as zero, not as null.

/// The outcome of a credit check, carrying the exact amount by which the order fits or does not.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// There is one <see cref="Amount"/> and its meaning is fixed by <see cref="Status"/>: remaining headroom
/// when approved, overage when refused. Two separate nullable fields would invite a caller to read the wrong
/// one; a single field cannot be misread, and both cases are non-negative by construction of the check rather
/// than by clamping a negative to zero.
///
/// The difference is never rounded or suppressed. A refusal that reports "over by BDT 0.01" is a real refusal
/// with a real repair — drop the order by one paisa, or raise the limit by one paisa — and an approval that
/// reports "0.00 headroom left" is the boundary case an owner will ask about, so it is stated exactly.

/// The implementation is the persistence layer's job (it is a query over the partner identifier table, plus
/// the bank-account and contact tables, all of which are indexed on the normalised value), and keeping it an
/// interface here is what lets the authoritative/suggestive split be tested without a Postgres.
///
/// It is deliberately a lookup by value rather than a search by name. A product that offered name search as
/// the duplicate control would put the decision back on a string a clerk typed, which is the defect this
/// module closes.

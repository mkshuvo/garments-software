/// <remarks>
/// A single verdict with no detail is how a duplicate check becomes noise: the clerk is told "possible
/// duplicate" and cannot see which party, on which number, so the warning is clicked through and the next
/// record is opened under a spelling variation anyway. The match list is part of the answer for that reason,
/// and it is ordered so two runs on the same data show the same list in the same order.
///
/// The verdict is computed from the strongest match present, never from the count of matches — five
/// suggestive hits on a phone number shared by four concerns are still a review, and one e-TIN hit is always
/// a refusal.

/// The style is a <see cref="StyleId"/>, not a copy of the catalogue's name, fabric or size curve. A price
/// line that stores a style name starts disagreeing with the catalogue the moment the style is renamed, and
/// a buyer's quotation that quotes "Navy Polo" while the catalogue says "Navy Polo Shirt" is two products to

/// <see cref="UnitPrice"/> must be positive: a price of zero is not "free", it is a missing price, and the
/// legacy tree's habit of defaulting a blank price field to zero is how a shipment went out invoiced at
/// nothing. A genuinely free issue is a hundred percent discount, which is stated here as an explicit
/// commercial decision and nets to zero on its own line.

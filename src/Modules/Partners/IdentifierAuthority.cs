/// The consequence of getting this backwards is asymmetric, and that asymmetry is the whole design:
/// confirming on something merely suggestive blocks a legitimate new party and teaches users to work
/// around the check; accepting an authoritative mismatch silently corrupts an aged-receivables report,
/// which is a worse outcome than an error message because nobody ever sees it.

/// Bangla is a first-class UI language for this product (law L17), and a party's Bangla name is the form
/// that appears on a local challan, a VAT invoice issued in Bangla, and the screen a Bangla-reading owner
/// actually scans. Keeping it in a separate field means the Latin legal name stays intact for the bank,
/// the letter of credit and the export documentation, which need it exactly as registered.
///
/// The field enforces its own meaning: it refuses text with no Bangla letter in it. Latin transliterations
/// are legitimate data, but they belong in the legal or trading name — storing <c>Sonali Cotton</c> here
/// would produce a "Bangla name" column that is silently English in most rows, which is how a first-class
/// language quietly becomes a nullable spare field again.

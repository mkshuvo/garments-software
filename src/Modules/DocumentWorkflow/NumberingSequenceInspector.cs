/// The allocator guarantees gaplessness going forward; this is what makes the guarantee checkable after
/// the fact, which is the difference between a rule and an assertion. It is the same idea as the
/// <c>Verifier</c> stage of the plan: a projection anyone can re-derive from the stored facts.
///
/// Cancelled documents must be in the list. Their numbers were consumed and belong in the series, and a
/// report that silently skipped them would report the absence of a cancelled document as a gap — which is
/// precisely the confusion between "deleted" and "never issued" that the no-gap rule exists to forbid.
///
/// A value below the scheme's starting value is not treated as a gap. Nothing in this module can move a
/// counter backwards — <see cref="NumberingErrorCode.CounterBelowStartingValue"/> refuses even that — so
/// a row carrying such a number was written by direct database access, which is a storage finding rather
/// than a numbering one.

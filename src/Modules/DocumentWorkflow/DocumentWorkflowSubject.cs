/// <remarks>
/// <see cref="History"/> is not a convenience. Rules like "the creator may not approve" and "this decision
/// is a correction of that one" are only evaluable from the record of decisions, and passing the record in
/// explicitly is what lets the engine be pure and tested without a database. It also makes the document's
/// claimed state checkable: <see cref="WorkflowErrorCode.HistoryDoesNotMatchState"/> fires when the state
/// column and the trail disagree, which is how a hand-edited row becomes visible instead of merely
/// suspicious.
///
/// <see cref="CreatorActorId"/> is required rather than nullable. A document with no named creator is a
/// document nobody can be stopped from approving, which is the exact hole the legacy
/// <c>Guid.Parse("00000000-…")</c> actor placeholder opened.
///
/// <see cref="TenantId"/> is declared by the caller rather than read from an ambient request context, so a
/// background job cannot decide a document belonging to the tenant that context happens to be holding.

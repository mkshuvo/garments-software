/// One live counter for one scheme in one period: the row the integrator locks before it takes a number.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Kept apart from <see cref="DocumentNumberingScheme"/> because the two change for different reasons
/// and only one of them is editable by a tenant. A scheme edit must never move a counter, and a
/// counter move must never be able to change how numbers are rendered.
///
/// <see cref="LastAllocationKey"/> and <see cref="LastAllocatedNumber"/> together are what make a retry
/// safe: a document that timed out after allocating re-reads this row, finds its own key already
/// recorded, and is handed back the number it already consumed instead of a second one. That is the
/// same idempotency idea as ledger invariant I5, applied before the ledger is ever reached.
///
/// <see cref="IssuedCount"/> exists so that "has this scheme issued anything?" is a fact on the row
/// rather than a query over documents, where a deleted document would quietly answer no.

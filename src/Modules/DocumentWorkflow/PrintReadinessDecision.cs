/// the lines to add up, so a screen, a PDF and a reprint of a three-year-old invoice cannot produce three
/// totals from one set of rows. When the check fails the renderer gets nothing to print, which is the
/// correct answer — a document whose own two accounts of its total disagree must not leave the building.

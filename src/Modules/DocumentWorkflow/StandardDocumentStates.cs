/// One list, used by every standard workflow, so that "approved" looks the same on a purchase order and a
/// payroll run and means the same to <see cref="DocumentEditPolicy"/>. Keeping the labels here rather than
/// in the web message bundles is deliberate: a state name is printed on paper that outlives wording
/// changes, and a translation table is the wrong place for a fact about a document.
///
/// The Bangla forms are the working wording for the pilot factories. The plan already books a native
/// review of accounting terms for the P9 Bangla assets pass, because a subtly wrong bookkeeping word on an
/// owner's screen is worse than an English one they can read; what matters here is that no state can exist
/// without a Bangla form at all, which <see cref="DocumentWorkflowDefinition.Validate"/> and
/// <see cref="DocumentPrintReadiness"/> both enforce.

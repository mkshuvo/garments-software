/// at print time is how a paper document stops matching the conversation that produced it.

/// <see cref="Amount"/> is <see cref="Money"/>, never a bare decimal: a line whose currency is implied is
/// the line that let a USD figure into a taka invoice, which is the defect <see cref="Currency"/> exists

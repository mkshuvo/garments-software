/// tenant, document type and period with <c>SELECT … FOR UPDATE</c>, call the allocator, persist the
/// sequence it returns, and write the document with the number it returned. Invariant I4's database-side
/// twin (a unique index on tenant, document type and number) backs this up, so a caller that skips this
/// interface gets an index violation instead of a readable error, and the rule does not depend on anyone
/// remembering to call it.

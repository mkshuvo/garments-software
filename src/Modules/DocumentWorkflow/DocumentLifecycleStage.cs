/// The rules read the stage, never a state name. That indirection is the whole point of doing workflows
/// here instead of in each module: a purchasing clerk's <c>"APPROVED"</c> and a sales clerk's
/// <c>"FINAL"</c> can both be <see cref="Approved"/>, so "nobody edits an approved document" is written
/// once and cannot be silently weaker in one module than another. The legacy tree expressed the same
/// idea as string comparisons scattered through services — <c>status == "Approved"</c> in one place,
/// <c>status == "FINALISED"</c> in another — and the three screens beside each other gave three answers
/// from one database.

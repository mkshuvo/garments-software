/// The single place any module asks "may this document move", so the answer is the same on the screen,
/// in the batch job and in the test. Rules are read off the definition
/// (<see cref="DocumentTransition.Actor"/>, <see cref="DocumentTransition.RequiresReason"/>,
/// <see cref="DocumentStateDefinition.IsTerminal"/>) rather than written where they are used, which is how
/// one document type's rule stops being weaker than another's.
///
/// It refuses, and nothing else: it does not save the document, does not touch the ledger and does not
/// mint ids. The integrator's job is to take an accepted decision and write the new state and
/// <see cref="DocumentWorkflowDecision.EntryToAppend"/> in the same transaction — the two halves of a
/// decision that cannot be separated, because a state change without its history entry is an approval
/// nobody can prove.
///
/// Every rule below can be traced to the failure it prevents: an approval by the creator (segregation of
/// duties on paper), an edit after approval (a document that changed after being agreed), a transition out
/// of a posted state (ledger invariant I3 being quietly weaker in the workflow than in the ledger), and a
/// decision whose reason was never written (a trail that cannot be reviewed).

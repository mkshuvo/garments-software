/// <para>
/// This is the numbering for <em>documents</em>, which is a different series from the ledger's journal
/// numbers and is not allowed to share one. A journal number is minted at post time by the posting
/// engine and proves that money moved; a document number is minted when the paper is created and proves
/// that the paper was registered. Collapsing them would mean an unapproved purchase order consumes a
/// voucher number, and the two questions an auditor asks — "which vouchers are missing" and "which
/// orders were never registered" — would stop having separate answers.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>No gaps, by construction and by absence.</b> The counter advances by exactly one per allocation and
/// this class has no <c>Release</c>, <c>Free</c>, <c>Recycle</c> or <c>Renumber</c> method, because a
/// cancelled document keeps the number it consumed. That is not tidiness: a gap made by deleting a
/// document is indistinguishable from a document that was never recorded, so the tenant cannot prove
/// which of the two happened, and neither can anyone else.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Pure.</b> Nothing here reaches a database. <see cref="Allocate"/> takes the counter row as read
/// and returns the counter row as it must be saved, so the integrator's job is exactly one transaction:
/// lock the row, call this, write what comes back. There is no SQL in this project to get wrong, and the
/// rules stay testable — the legacy numbering had the SQL and the rule interleaved in one service and
/// nobody could say which of the two was lying.

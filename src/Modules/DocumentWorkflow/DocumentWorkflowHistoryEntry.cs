/// One decision about one document, recorded forever: who, when, from where, to where, and why.

/// <remarks>
/// A record with <c>init</c> properties, so "append-only history" is a property of the type rather than a
/// promise in a service: there is nothing to update, and a store that wanted to rewrite an entry would
/// have to construct a second row that pretends to be the first. Reversing a decision therefore adds
/// another entry with <see cref="CorrectsEntryId"/> pointing at the original, which keeps both visible —
/// the workflow version of the ledger's rule that a posted entry is corrected by a reversal, never by an
/// edit. A history that could be rewritten would leave an approver free to change their mind
/// retroactively, which is exactly the thing a signed approval is supposed to make impossible.
///
/// <see cref="Id"/> is empty until the store writes the row. The engine that decides the transition is
/// not the component that allocates identifiers, and an id minted here would be another cash-book
/// controller reporting a saved journal that no one saved.

/// The fields that decide a number's <em>identity</em> — prefix, padding width, period component, fiscal
/// start month, starting value — are frozen the moment the scheme issues anything. The fields that only
/// describe it (the settings-screen name in both languages) stay editable. Everything else about a
/// scheme can change, but these cannot, because documents already in circulation carry a string built
/// from them and an auditor is entitled to hold that string against this rule forever.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why a narrower width is refused outright.</b> Padding is the only thing keeping a series the same
/// length, and there are exactly three responses to a value that outgrows a reduced width. Truncate:
/// the value 12 renders as <c>12</c> where <c>12</c> was already issued as <c>0012</c>, so the tenant has
/// built two documents with one number — the failure this rule exists to prevent. Grow silently: the
/// series now mixes lengths, and ordering it as text puts <c>SO-9</c> after <c>SO-10</c>, which is the
/// legacy voucher bug and reads to an auditor as a gap. Refuse: the only honest option, and the one
/// taken here.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why a wider width is allowed.</b> Widening can never re-render an issued value into a string that
/// already exists, because values only ever move forward. It costs a consistent-looking series, which is
/// cosmetic, and the printed length of a number is allowed to grow when a factory outgrows four digits.

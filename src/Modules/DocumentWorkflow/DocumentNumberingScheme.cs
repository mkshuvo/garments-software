/// <summary>
/// A tenant's rule for numbering one document type: a prefix, a fixed width, a period component and
/// the value a new period starts from.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This is configuration — the part a tenant edits — and it is deliberately separate from
/// <see cref="NumberingSequenceState"/>, which is the counter itself. Merging them, as the legacy
/// <c>GenerateJournalNumberAsync</c> effectively did by reading the current maximum back out of the
/// documents table, is what makes numbering rules drift: the next value then depends on which rows
/// happen to be visible, and a document that is deleted lowers the maximum for everyone after it.
///
/// <see cref="Width"/> is a promise about printed length, not decoration. See
/// <see cref="NumberingSchemeEditValidator"/>: a narrower width re-renders the same value into a
/// shorter string, and the only ways to keep a fixed length are to truncate — which re-issues a number
/// that already exists — or to let the number silently grow, which is how <c>JE-2025-01-9</c> came to
/// sort above <c>JE-2025-01-10</c> in the legacy voucher list.

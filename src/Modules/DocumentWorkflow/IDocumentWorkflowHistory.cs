/// There is no update or delete method on this interface, and that absence is the append-only rule
/// expressed in the shape a module can call. A history that can be rewritten is not a record of what was
/// decided but of what somebody currently wants it to look like, and correcting a decision by editing it
/// destroys the one thing the trail exists to keep: that a document was approved by a named person on a
/// named day, and that the position later changed. The lawful way to change a recorded decision is
/// another entry with <see cref="DocumentWorkflowHistoryEntry.CorrectsEntryId"/> set.
///
/// Implemented beside the database context by the integrator, like the ledger's
/// <see cref="Garments.Ledger.IPoster"/>: assigning the row id, ordering by
/// <see cref="DocumentWorkflowHistoryEntry.EntryNumber"/> per document, and enforcing that ordering with a
/// unique index are storage jobs, not domain ones.

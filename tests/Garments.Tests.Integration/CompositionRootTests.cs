/// The legacy build compiled cleanly while 22 of its 35 service registrations sat commented out in
/// Program.cs; each affected controller threw only when a request reached it, and no request ever
/// reached them because the frontend could not build either. This test makes that state
/// unshippable: a controller whose dependencies were never registered fails the gate, not the
/// customer. Controllers are discovered from the assemblies rather than from the route table, so a
/// controller that was never mapped cannot slip through by being unreachable.

# Garments ERP Development Progress

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive Garments ERP system with ASP.NET Core Web API backend and Next.js frontend.

## Latest Progress — Journal Entry Management (2025-09-01)
- Frontend enhancements:
  - Implemented `PrintModal` with page size/orientation options and integrated on `journal-entries` page.
  - Added `SummarySection` and `StatusFilter`; refactored page to use `journalEntryService` (typed DTOs, export, stats).
  - Fixed Material-UI `Grid` usage across new components; removed duplicate interfaces; unified filter state with status.
  - Resolved all TypeScript/ESLint warnings; frontend builds clean.
- UX and reliability:
  - Added `ErrorBoundary`, `TableSkeletonLoader`, `LoadingSpinner`, `ProgressIndicator`, `ConfirmationDialog`, `EnhancedTooltip`, and `KeyboardShortcuts` (installed `react-hotkeys-hook`).
- Planning updates (.plan/journal-entry-management/tasks.md):
  - Marked complete: `TASK-005.1`, `TASK-004.1`, `TASK-004.3`, `TASK-006.1`, `TASK-006.2`, `TASK-006.3`. `TASK-003.2` partially (StatusFilter).
- Next steps to pick up:
  - `TASK-005.3` client-side caching; `TASK-007` security; `TASK-008` performance; `TASK-009` testing; finalize `TASK-003.x` refinements and `TASK-004.2` enhancements.

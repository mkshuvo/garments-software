# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the infinite redirect loop issue that occurs when refreshing the page at `http://localhost:4000/admin/accounting/cash-book-entry`. The user sees "Redirecting to login..." and the page keeps loading infinitely without actually redirecting to the login page.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Authentication State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to refresh any admin page without getting stuck in an infinite redirect loop, so that I can navigate the application reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user refreshes an admin page THEN the authentication state should be properly validated
2. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN they should see the requested page content
3. WHEN the user is not authenticated THEN they should be redirected to the login page within 2 seconds
4. WHEN there is an authentication error THEN the user should see a clear error message instead of infinite loading

### Requirement 2: Implement Development Authentication Bypass

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to bypass authentication during development, so that I can test the application features without setting up a full authentication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN authentication should be bypassed for admin routes
2. WHEN authentication is bypassed THEN a mock user should be provided to the application
3. WHEN authentication is bypassed THEN all permission checks should pass
4. WHEN switching to production mode THEN full authentication should be enforced

### Requirement 3: Improve Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear feedback when authentication fails, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is loading THEN the user should see a loading indicator with descriptive text
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the user should see an error message explaining the issue
3. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the user should see a message about service unavailability
4. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the loading state should be cleared immediately

### Requirement 4: Backend Service Health Check

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the backend service is running and accessible, so that authentication can work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend starts THEN it should check if the backend is accessible
2. WHEN the backend is not accessible THEN the frontend should show a service unavailable message
3. WHEN the backend becomes available THEN the frontend should automatically retry authentication
4. WHEN running in development mode THEN health check failures should not block the application

### Requirement 5: Graceful Fallback for Missing Backend

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to work even when the backend is not running, so that I can develop and test frontend features independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is not running THEN the frontend should use mock authentication
2. WHEN using mock authentication THEN all admin features should be accessible
3. WHEN the backend becomes available THEN the frontend should switch to real authentication
4. WHEN switching between mock and real authentication THEN the user experience should be seamless

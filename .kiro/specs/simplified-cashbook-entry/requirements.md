# Improved Cash Book Entry UI - Requirements

## Introduction

The current cash book entry system has poor user interface design where adding credit and debit transactions creates forms stacked vertically below each other, making the interface cluttered and difficult to use. This spec redesigns the user interface to provide a cleaner, more professional experience while maintaining the current balanced double-entry bookkeeping approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modal Dialog for Transaction Entry

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add credit and debit transactions through modal dialogs instead of forms stacking vertically, so that I have a clean and organized interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Add Credit" THEN a modal dialog SHALL open with credit transaction fields
2. WHEN I click "Add Debit" THEN a modal dialog SHALL open with debit transaction fields
3. WHEN I complete a transaction in the modal THEN it SHALL close and show the transaction in a clean list
4. WHEN I want to edit a transaction THEN clicking on it SHALL open the same modal with pre-filled data
5. WHEN I have multiple transactions THEN they SHALL be displayed in an organized table/list format

### Requirement 2: Single Modal Form Per Transaction

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a single modal dialog popup for each transaction entry, not forms generated inside the page or stacked under each other, so that I have a clean and focused interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Add Credit" THEN a modal dialog SHALL popup over the current page with a single credit transaction form
2. WHEN I click "Add Debit" THEN a modal dialog SHALL popup over the current page with a single debit transaction form
3. WHEN I complete the transaction in the modal THEN it SHALL close and add the transaction to the list
4. WHEN I want to add another transaction THEN I SHALL click the button again to get a fresh modal popup
5. WHEN I have the modal open THEN no forms SHALL be generated inside the main page or stacked under each other

### Requirement 3: Clean Transaction Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my credit and debit transactions in a clean, organized format instead of stacked forms, so that I can easily review and manage my entries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add transactions THEN they SHALL be displayed in a clean table format with columns for type, amount, category, etc.
2. WHEN I have multiple transactions THEN each SHALL be clearly separated and easy to identify
3. WHEN I want to remove a transaction THEN I SHALL have a clear delete button for each entry
4. WHEN I want to edit a transaction THEN I SHALL be able to click on it to reopen the modal/page
5. WHEN I view the transaction list THEN I SHALL see running totals for credits and debits

### Requirement 4: Modal Dialog Focus and Behavior

**User Story:** As a user, I want the modal dialog to behave properly as a popup overlay, so that I can focus on entering one transaction at a time without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a modal opens THEN it SHALL appear as a popup overlay on top of the main page
2. WHEN the modal is open THEN the background SHALL be dimmed and I SHALL not be able to interact with the main page
3. WHEN I complete or cancel the modal THEN it SHALL close completely and return focus to the main page
4. WHEN I want to add multiple transactions THEN I SHALL need to click the "Add Credit" or "Add Debit" button each time to get a new modal
5. WHEN the modal is closed THEN no transaction forms SHALL remain visible on the main page

### Requirement 5: Responsive Modal Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want the modal dialogs to be well-designed and responsive, so that I can easily enter transaction data on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a modal opens THEN it SHALL be properly centered and sized for the content
2. WHEN I use the modal on mobile THEN it SHALL adapt to the smaller screen size
3. WHEN I click outside the modal THEN it SHALL close (with confirmation if data is entered)
4. WHEN I press Escape key THEN the modal SHALL close
5. WHEN the modal is open THEN the background SHALL be dimmed and interaction with the main page SHALL be disabled

### Requirement 6: Improved Page Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth navigation when using separate pages for transaction entry, so that the workflow feels seamless and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to a transaction entry page THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and fast
2. WHEN I complete a transaction entry THEN I SHALL be redirected back with a success message
3. WHEN I cancel transaction entry THEN I SHALL return to the previous page without saving
4. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN my main cashbook data SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN I use browser back button THEN it SHALL work correctly without breaking the application

### Requirement 7: Maintain Current Accounting Logic

**User Story:** As a user, I want to keep the current balanced double-entry system that requires credits to equal debits, so that proper accounting principles are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add credit and debit transactions THEN the system SHALL continue to require that total credits equal total debits
2. WHEN I try to save an unbalanced entry THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and show the balance difference
3. WHEN I view transaction totals THEN I SHALL see running totals for credits and debits clearly displayed
4. WHEN I complete a balanced entry THEN the system SHALL allow saving with confirmation
5. WHEN I have an unbalanced entry THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate what needs to be corrected

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality to continue working while the interface is improved, so that no features are lost during the upgrade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new interface is implemented THEN all existing cashbook entries SHALL remain accessible
2. WHEN I use the improved interface THEN all current features SHALL still be available
3. WHEN I save transactions THEN they SHALL be stored in the same format as before
4. WHEN I generate reports THEN they SHALL include all transactions regardless of which interface was used
5. WHEN I export data THEN the format SHALL remain compatible with existing systems

## Success Criteria

- Users can add credit/debit transactions without forms stacking vertically
- Modal dialogs provide a clean, professional interface for transaction entry
- Alternative page-based entry is available for users who prefer it
- Transaction list displays in an organized, easy-to-read format
- Current balanced double-entry accounting logic is preserved
- Interface works well on both desktop and mobile devices

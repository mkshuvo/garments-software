## Introduction

The Trial Balance Reporting feature provides comprehensive financial reporting capabilities for the Garments ERP system. This feature enables users to generate trial balance reports for any selected date range, showing the balance of expenses, income, assets, and liabilities. The trial balance is a fundamental accounting report that ensures the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) is balanced and provides insights into the financial position of the business.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to generate trial balance reports for specific date ranges, so that I can verify the accuracy of the accounting records and analyze the financial position of the business.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the trial balance section THEN the system SHALL display a date range selector with default values set to the current month
2. WHEN I select a custom date range THEN the system SHALL validate that the start date is not later than the end date
3. WHEN I click "Generate Report" THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the trial balance data for the selected period
4. WHEN the report is generated THEN the system SHALL show all account categories with their respective debit and credit balances
5. WHEN displaying balances THEN the system SHALL represent debit transactions as negative values and credit transactions as positive values
6. WHEN the report is displayed THEN the system SHALL calculate the running sum of all transactions (debits as negative, credits as positive) and show the final trial balance total
7. WHEN the final calculation is shown THEN the system SHALL display the mathematical expression (e.g., "1000 - 1100 + 11000 - 1000 = 9900") and the resulting trial balance amount

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to view categorized account balances in the trial balance, so that I can understand the financial breakdown by account types (Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Income, Expenses).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the trial balance is generated THEN the system SHALL group accounts by their categories (Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Income, Expenses)
2. WHEN displaying account categories THEN the system SHALL show each category as a collapsible section with subtotals
3. WHEN an account has transactions in the selected period THEN the system SHALL display the account name, category description, particulars/description, transaction amounts (debits as negative, credits as positive), and running balance
4. WHEN calculating account totals THEN the system SHALL sum all debits as negative values and credits as positive values for each account
5. WHEN an account has zero net balance THEN the system SHALL optionally hide it based on user preference
6. WHEN displaying balances THEN the system SHALL format all monetary values consistently with proper currency symbols and decimal places

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to export trial balance reports to PDF and CSV formats, so that I can share the reports with stakeholders and maintain records for compliance purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a generated trial balance THEN the system SHALL provide export options for PDF and CSV formats
2. WHEN I export to PDF THEN the system SHALL generate a professionally formatted report with company header, date range, and proper formatting
3. WHEN I export to CSV THEN the system SHALL include all account details with columns for Account Name, Category, Transaction Amount (with sign), Running Balance, and the final trial balance calculation
4. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include the generation timestamp and selected date range in the export
5. WHEN the export is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically download the file with a descriptive filename

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to compare trial balances across different periods, so that I can identify trends and changes in account balances over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the comparison feature THEN the system SHALL allow me to select two different date ranges for comparison
2. WHEN I generate a comparison report THEN the system SHALL display both periods side by side with variance calculations
3. WHEN showing variances THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the difference in amounts and percentage changes
4. WHEN variances are significant THEN the system SHALL highlight accounts with changes above a configurable threshold
5. WHEN displaying comparison data THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent formatting and allow sorting by variance amount

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the trial balance to load quickly and handle large datasets efficiently, so that I can generate reports without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a trial balance THEN the system SHALL complete the calculation within 5 seconds for datasets up to 10,000 transactions
2. WHEN the system is processing THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with progress information
3. WHEN large datasets are involved THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtual scrolling for account lists
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages and retry options

2. WHEN viewing account details THEN the system SHALL show transaction date, category description, particulars/description, reference number, debit/credit amounts, and running balance
3. WHEN in drill-down mode THEN the system SHALL provide a breadcrumb navigation to return to the main trial balance
4. WHEN viewing transaction details THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by date, amount, or description
5. WHEN I need more information THEN the system SHALL provide links to view the complete transaction or journal entry details

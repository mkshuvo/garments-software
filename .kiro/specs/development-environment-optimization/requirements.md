# Development Environment Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This spec addresses the need to optimize the Docker-based development environment for the GarmentsERP application. The current setup has slow build times, health check issues, and inefficient container management that impacts developer productivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fast Container Startup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want containers to start quickly so that I can begin development work without long wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `make docker-dev` THEN the entire stack SHALL start within 2 minutes
2. WHEN I make code changes THEN hot reload SHALL work without container restart
3. WHEN containers are already built THEN startup SHALL take less than 30 seconds
4. IF a service fails to start THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 2: Reliable Health Checks

**User Story:** As a developer, I want accurate health checks so that I know when services are actually ready to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a container is healthy THEN the service SHALL be fully functional
2. WHEN a health check fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details
3. WHEN the backend is ready THEN the health check SHALL pass within 60 seconds
4. IF health checks are misconfigured THEN the system SHALL use fallback methods

### Requirement 3: Efficient Build Process

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient Docker builds so that I don't waste time waiting for unnecessary rebuilds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN source code changes THEN only affected layers SHALL rebuild
2. WHEN dependencies haven't changed THEN cached layers SHALL be reused
3. WHEN building for development THEN build time SHALL be optimized over image size
4. IF build fails THEN the error SHALL be clearly identified and actionable

### Requirement 4: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration between local development and containerized services so that I can work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create an admin user THEN the command SHALL work reliably
2. WHEN services are running THEN I SHALL be able to access all admin interfaces
3. WHEN I need to debug THEN I SHALL have easy access to logs and container status
4. IF a service is down THEN I SHALL get clear instructions on how to fix it

### Requirement 5: Resource Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized resource usage so that my development machine runs smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers are running THEN memory usage SHALL be reasonable for development
2. WHEN not actively developing THEN I SHALL be able to easily stop all services
3. WHEN containers restart THEN data SHALL persist appropriately
4. IF resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential services

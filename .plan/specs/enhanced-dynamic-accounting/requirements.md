# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing MM Fashion cash book accounting system to create a fully dynamic, user-friendly accounting solution. The system must allow admin users to dynamically create categories, manage suppliers/buyers, maintain proper double-entry bookkeeping, generate monthly trial balances, and provide immutable transaction records for completed transactions. The UI must be highly intuitive and support A4 printing for trial balance reports.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Category Management

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to dynamically create and manage accounting categories, so that I can adapt the chart of accounts to changing business needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user accesses the category management interface THEN the system SHALL display all existing categories with their debit/credit classification
2. WHEN an admin user creates a new category THEN the system SHALL allow selection of category type (Credit/Revenue or Debit/Expense)

4. WHEN an admin user edits a category THEN the system SHALL prevent changes to category type if transactions exist for that category
5. WHEN an admin user attempts to delete a category THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion if transactions exist and show warning message
6. WHEN categories are displayed THEN the system SHALL show hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships
7. WHEN a category is deactivated THEN the system SHALL hide it from new transaction entry but preserve historical data

### Requirement 2: Independent Supplier and Buyer Management

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to independently create and manage suppliers and buyers under categories, so that I can maintain accurate contact relationships for accounting transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user accesses supplier management THEN the system SHALL display all suppliers with their associated categories
2. WHEN an admin user creates a new supplier THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to multiple categories
3. WHEN an admin user creates a new buyer THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to multiple categories  
4. WHEN a supplier/buyer is created THEN the system SHALL capture contact details (name, company, phone, email, address)
5. WHEN a supplier/buyer is assigned to a category THEN the system SHALL validate that the assignment makes business sense (suppliers for expense categories, buyers for revenue categories)
6. WHEN displaying suppliers/buyers THEN the system SHALL show their transaction history and outstanding balances
7. WHEN a supplier/buyer is deactivated THEN the system SHALL preserve historical transaction data

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Cash Book Entry Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive split-screen cash book entry interface that matches the MM Fashion format, so that I can efficiently enter transactions with familiar workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses cash book entry THEN the system SHALL display split-screen layout with Credit (left) and Debit (right) sides
2. WHEN entering credit transactions THEN the system SHALL provide auto-complete for categories, suppliers, and buyers
3. WHEN entering debit transactions THEN the system SHALL provide auto-complete for categories, suppliers, and buyers
4. WHEN transaction amounts are entered THEN the system SHALL show real-time balance calculation and validation
5. WHEN the transaction is unbalanced THEN the system SHALL display clear visual indicators and prevent saving
6. WHEN all required fields are completed and balanced THEN the system SHALL enable the save button
7. WHEN a transaction is saved THEN the system SHALL generate proper double-entry journal entries automatically
8. WHEN entering dates THEN the system SHALL support multiple date formats (dd-MM-yyyy, dd-MM-yy) as per MM Fashion format

### Requirement 4: Proper Accounting Ledger Implementation

**User Story:** As an accounting user, I want the system to maintain proper double-entry bookkeeping with complete audit trails, so that financial records comply with accounting standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a cash book entry is saved THEN the system SHALL create balanced journal entries with equal debits and credits
2. WHEN journal entries are created THEN the system SHALL update account balances in real-time
3. WHEN transactions are posted THEN the system SHALL maintain complete audit trail with user, timestamp, and reference numbers
4. WHEN account balances are calculated THEN the system SHALL follow proper accounting rules (Assets/Expenses = Debit balance, Liabilities/Equity/Revenue = Credit balance)
5. WHEN viewing account ledgers THEN the system SHALL display chronological transaction history with running balances
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL ensure all transactions are properly classified and balanced
7. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent data corruption

### Requirement 5: Transaction Immutability for Completed Transactions

**User Story:** As a financial controller, I want completed transactions to be immutable, so that financial integrity is maintained and audit requirements are met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN a completed transaction needs correction THEN the system SHALL require creation of a reversing entry
4. WHEN viewing completed transactions THEN the system SHALL display lock icon and completion timestamp
5. WHEN generating audit reports THEN the system SHALL show all transaction status changes with user and timestamp
6. WHEN a transaction is completed THEN the system SHALL send notification to relevant users
7. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL respect immutability rules for completed transactions

### Requirement 6: Monthly Trial Balance Generation and Printing

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to generate monthly trial balance reports that can be printed on A4 paper, so that I can review financial position and meet reporting requirements.

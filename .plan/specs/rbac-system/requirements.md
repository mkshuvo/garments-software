# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing and enhancing the existing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for the Garments ERP application. The current system has a solid foundation with ASP.NET Core Identity, JWT authentication, and a comprehensive permission system, but experiences authentication redirect loops, 401 unauthorized errors, and missing permission assignments. This enhancement will fix existing issues, complete the permission assignments, and improve the user experience.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Components (Working)
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Identity with ApplicationUser and ApplicationRole
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication with AuthService
- **Permission System**: Comprehensive permission service with resource-action based permissions
- **Database Schema**: Users, Roles, Permissions, UserPermissions, RolePermissions tables
- **Authorization Attribute**: RequirePermissionAttribute for API endpoint protection
- **Frontend**: Zustand auth store, auth service, and basic route protection

### Issues to Fix
- **Category Controller**: Only has [Authorize] but no specific permission requirements
- **Frontend Redirect Loops**: Authentication state synchronization issues
- **Missing Permission Assignments**: Default roles don't have permissions assigned
- **Token Synchronization**: Issues between auth store and API service
- **Route Protection**: ProtectedRoute component has timing issues

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to properly assign permissions to existing roles and manage them centrally, so that I can control access to different parts of the application based on user responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL ensure default permissions are assigned to existing roles (Admin, Manager, Employee)
2. WHEN an admin accesses role management THEN the system SHALL display all available roles with their current permissions
3. WHEN an admin modifies role permissions THEN the system SHALL update access for all users with that role immediately
4. WHEN a new permission is created THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to appropriate roles
5. IF a role's permissions are modified THEN the system SHALL log the change for audit purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate once and access all authorized features without redirect loops, so that I can work efficiently without authentication interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL store authentication state persistently
2. WHEN a user accesses an authorized page THEN the system SHALL allow access without additional authentication
3. WHEN a user accesses an unauthorized page THEN the system SHALL display a proper access denied message
4. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with a clear message
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL NOT create redirect loops between pages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly apply permission requirements to API endpoints, so that authorization is consistently enforced across all backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the category API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL check for appropriate category permissions
2. WHEN a protected endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL use RequirePermissionAttribute to verify permissions
3. WHEN permission is denied THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden status with clear error message
4. WHEN authentication is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized status
5. IF category permissions are missing THEN the system SHALL assign default permissions to roles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want React components that automatically handle authorization, so that UI elements are shown/hidden based on user permissions without manual checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads a page THEN the system SHALL only display UI elements they have permission to access
2. WHEN user permissions change THEN the system SHALL update the UI immediately without page refresh
3. WHEN a protected component is accessed THEN the system SHALL check permissions before rendering
4. WHEN permission is denied THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback content
5. IF user has no permissions for a page THEN the system SHALL redirect to an appropriate default page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business user, I want different access levels for different modules (accounting, inventory, etc.), so that users only see features relevant to their job function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the accounting module THEN the system SHALL verify accounting permissions
2. WHEN a user accesses category management THEN the system SHALL check category management permissions
3. WHEN a user accesses inventory features THEN the system SHALL verify inventory permissions
4. WHEN a user lacks module permissions THEN the system SHALL hide the module from navigation
5. IF a user tries to directly access unauthorized modules THEN the system SHALL show access denied page

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to audit user access and permission changes, so that I can track security events and compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL log the authentication event with timestamp and IP
2. WHEN permissions are modified THEN the system SHALL log who made the change and what was changed
3. WHEN access is denied THEN the system SHALL log the attempted access with user and resource details
4. WHEN roles are created or modified THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL flag it for administrator review

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use the existing admin setup functionality and enhance it with proper permission assignments, so that there's always a way to access and manage the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the first admin is created via /setup-admin THEN the system SHALL assign all necessary permissions to the Admin role
2. WHEN an admin user is created THEN the system SHALL ensure they have access to user and role management
3. WHEN creating additional admin users THEN the system SHALL require existing admin privileges
4. WHEN the last admin is being deleted THEN the system SHALL prevent the action
5. IF no admin exists THEN the system SHALL allow the setup-admin endpoint to be used

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to work reliably without redirect loops, so that I can access authorized features seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL properly synchronize authentication state between auth store and API service
2. WHEN a user navigates to protected pages THEN the system SHALL not create redirect loops
3. WHEN authentication state is restored from storage THEN the system SHALL properly set API tokens
4. WHEN a user accesses unauthorized resources THEN the system SHALL show appropriate access denied messages
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to login only once without loops

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user with appropriate permissions, I want to access category management features, so that I can perform my job functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with category permissions accesses /admin/accounting/categories THEN the system SHALL allow access
2. WHEN category API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL check for specific category permissions
3. WHEN a user lacks category permissions THEN the system SHALL show access denied instead of 401 errors
4. WHEN category permissions are assigned to roles THEN users with those roles SHALL have access
5. IF category permissions are missing THEN the system SHALL create and assign default category permissions

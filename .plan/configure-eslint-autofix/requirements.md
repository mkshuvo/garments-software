## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### US1: Developer Code Quality
**As a** developer  
**I want** ESLint to automatically fix code issues when I save files  
**So that** I can maintain consistent code quality without manual intervention

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Saving a file automatically fixes all auto-fixable ESLint issues
- ✅ Import statements are automatically sorted and organized
- ✅ Unused imports are automatically removed
- ✅ Code formatting is consistent across the team
- ✅ TypeScript-specific issues are caught and fixed where possible

### US2: Team Consistency
**As a** team lead  
**I want** standardized ESLint configuration across all development environments  
**So that** code quality and style remain consistent regardless of developer setup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ VS Code workspace settings enforce consistent linting behavior
- ✅ All team members see the same errors and warnings
- ✅ Autofix behavior is identical across different machines
- ✅ Configuration is version-controlled and easily shareable

### US3: CI/CD Integration
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** automated linting and fixing in the build pipeline  
**So that** code quality issues are caught and resolved before deployment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks automatically fix issues before commits
- ✅ Build pipeline fails on unfixable linting errors
- ✅ Automated fixes are applied during development builds
- ✅ Linting performance doesn't significantly impact build times

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **Next.js Build System**: Integrate with existing `next lint` commands
- **TypeScript Compiler**: Coordinate with TSC for type checking
- **Jest Testing**: Ensure linting rules don't conflict with test files
- **Docker Development**: Work within containerized development environment

### External Tools
- **Git Hooks**: Integration with Husky for pre-commit linting
- **VS Code**: Workspace configuration for consistent developer experience
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integration with existing build and deployment processes

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing Next.js 15.x setup
- Cannot break current build and development workflows
- Must work with existing TypeScript configuration
- Should not significantly increase build times

### Assumptions
- Developers are using VS Code as primary editor
- Team is committed to following automated code quality standards
- Existing codebase can be gradually migrated to new standards
- Development environment supports Node.js and npm/yarn

- **Accessibility**: Enforce WCAG guidelines through jsx-a11y rules
- **Security**: Implement security-focused linting rules
- **Performance**: Rules to prevent common performance anti-patterns
- **Maintainability**: Enforce clean code principles and best practices

### Documentation Requirements
- All custom rules must be documented with examples
- Configuration changes must be tracked in version control
- Developer onboarding guide for ESLint setup

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Code Quality**: 90% reduction in manual code review comments related to formatting
- **Developer Productivity**: 25% reduction in time spent on code formatting tasks
- **Error Reduction**: 50% decrease in runtime errors related to common linting issues

- **Learning Curve**: Team adaptation to new automated fixing behavior

### Low Risk
- **Tool Compatibility**: Modern ESLint versions are well-supported
- **Rollback Capability**: Configuration changes can be easily reverted

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Gradual Implementation**: Introduce rules incrementally to avoid overwhelming changes
2. **Team Training**: Provide documentation and training on new ESLint features
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track and optimize linting performance throughout implementation
4. **Fallback Options**: Maintain ability to disable autofix for specific scenarios
5. **Regular Review**: Schedule periodic reviews of rule effectiveness and team feedback

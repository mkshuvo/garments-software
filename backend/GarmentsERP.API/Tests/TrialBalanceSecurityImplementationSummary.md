  - Comprehensive malicious content detection

### 5. Frontend Security Utilities

#### Frontend Components
- **Security Utils** (`frontend/src/utils/securityUtils.ts`)
  - Client-side input validation and sanitization
  - Rate limiting helper for client-side enforcement
  - Secure storage utilities
  - Trial balance specific validation functions
  - Malicious content detection

- **Updated Trial Balance Service** (`frontend/src/services/trialBalanceService.ts`)
  - Integrated client-side rate limiting
  - Input validation before API calls
  - Security-aware error handling

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Server-side**: All inputs are sanitized using InputSanitizationService
- **Client-side**: Frontend validation before API calls
- **XSS Prevention**: HTML encoding of all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Pattern detection and parameterized queries

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **Distributed**: Redis-based rate limiting across multiple server instances
- **Endpoint-specific**: Different limits for different operations
- **User-aware**: Rate limiting per user ID when authenticated
- **IP-based fallback**: Rate limiting by IP address for unauthenticated requests

### 3. Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive**: All trial balance operations are logged
- **Secure**: Sensitive data is masked in logs
- **Performance-aware**: Audit logging failures don't break main functionality
- **Queryable**: Audit logs can be searched by user, date, action, etc.

### 4. Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Sensitive financial data can be encrypted at rest
- **Hashing**: One-way hashing for sensitive identifiers
- **Masking**: Sensitive data is masked in logs and error messages
- **Secure Headers**: Proper HTTP headers for security

### 5. Error Handling
- **No Information Disclosure**: Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- **Consistent Responses**: Standardized error response format
- **Logging**: All errors are logged with appropriate detail levels
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function even with security service failures

## Configuration and Deployment

### Environment Variables
```json
{
  "Encryption": {
    "Key": "32-character-encryption-key",
    "IV": "16-character-iv",
    "Salt": "salt-for-hashing"
  }
}
```

### Service Registration
All security services are registered in `Program.cs`:
- ITrialBalanceAuditService
- IRateLimitingService
- IDataEncryptionService
- IInputSanitizationService

### Middleware Pipeline
Rate limiting middleware is added to the ASP.NET Core pipeline before authentication.

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- Comprehensive unit tests for all security services
- Integration tests for audit logging
- Rate limiting validation tests
- Input sanitization tests with malicious inputs

### Security Validation
- XSS attack prevention validated
- SQL injection prevention validated
- Rate limiting effectiveness validated
- Audit log integrity validated

## Performance Considerations

### Audit Logging
- Asynchronous logging to prevent blocking main operations
- Automatic cleanup of old audit logs
- Indexed database tables for efficient queries

### Rate Limiting
- Redis-based for high performance
- Efficient sliding window algorithm
- Minimal memory footprint

### Encryption
- Only used for truly sensitive data to minimize performance impact
- Efficient AES-256 implementation
- Caching of encryption keys

## Security Best Practices Followed

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
3. **Fail Secure**: Security failures default to secure state
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
5. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all activities
6. **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages
7. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
8. **Data Protection**: Encryption and masking of sensitive data

## Compliance and Standards

The implementation follows:
- OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework principles
- Industry best practices for financial data protection
- GDPR considerations for audit logging and data protection

## Future Enhancements

1. **Key Management**: Integration with Azure Key Vault or similar
2. **Advanced Threat Detection**: ML-based anomaly detection
3. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Additional authentication layers
4. **Data Loss Prevention**: Advanced data protection measures
5. **Security Monitoring**: Real-time security event monitoring

## Conclusion

The implemented security features provide comprehensive protection for the trial balance reporting system, including audit logging, rate limiting, input sanitization, data encryption, and proper error handling. The system follows security best practices and provides a solid foundation for secure financial reporting operations.
